# Learn NodeJS

This is a repository used to learn NodeJS. Time to explore :)

### Starting point
The repository started from : https://github.com/geshan/nodejs-postgres-docker-compose (Thank you!)

While testing other repositories to become the starting point, 
this was the best one because it was working, and it is a simple project with a good potential.

To start the containers : docker-compose up -d

To stop and remove the containers : docker-compose down --rmi all

To connect to the api container : docker exec -it "container name" /bin/sh
